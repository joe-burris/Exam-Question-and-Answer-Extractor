    "question_type": "Multiple choice or Written answer",
    "given_data": [
      {
        "statement": "Any given data or conditions (use LaTeX for mathematical expressions). Non-bulleted information from the problem statement is still relevant and should be included here (especially text horizontally aligned with the problem number)."
      },
      {
        "statement": "include as a new statement in the json structure each new bullet or paragraph break."
      },
    ],
    "problem_statement": "The core question being asked",
    "options": {
      "A": "Option A text",
